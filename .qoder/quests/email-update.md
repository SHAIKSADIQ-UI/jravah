# Email Address Update Design Document

## Overview
This document outlines the design for updating the contact email address across the JRavah Foods website from `support@jravahfoods.com` to `info@jravahfoods.com`.

## Current State Analysis
After analyzing the website files, the following observations were made:
- The current email address `support@jravahfoods.com` is used consistently across 15 locations in the website
- The email appears in multiple HTML files including:
  - Main pages: JRavah.html, about.html, contact.html
  - Product category pages: Pickels.html, Snacks.html, Spices.html, Sweets.html
  - Policy pages: Privacypolicy.html, Returns.html, Shipping policy.html
  - Shopping pages: product-single.html, shopus3.html, viewcart.html

## Design Approach
To maintain consistency and ensure all instances are updated properly, the following approach will be taken:

1. Replace all occurrences of `support@jravahfoods.com` with `info@jravahfoods.com`
2. Update both the display text and the mailto links to maintain functionality
3. Ensure the change is applied uniformly across all identified files

## Implementation Strategy
The update will involve modifying the following files:
- JRavah.html
- Pickels.html
- Privacypolicy.html
- Returns.html
- Shipping policy.html
- Snacks.html
- Snacks3.html
- Spices.html
- Sweets.html
- about.html
- contact.html
- product-single.html
- shopus3.html
- viewcart.html

## Validation
After implementing the changes, verification will be performed to ensure:
- All instances have been updated correctly
- Mailto links function properly with the new email address
- Display text matches the new email address
- No broken links or formatting issues were introduced

## Rollout Plan
The email address update should be implemented as a single coordinated change across all files to maintain consistency. All updates should be deployed simultaneously to avoid mixed email addresses on the live site.  - Policy pages: Privacypolicy.html, Returns.html, Shipping policy.html
  - Shopping pages: product-single.html, shopus3.html, viewcart.html
